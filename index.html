    I am an assistant professor (US tenure-track equivalent) in mathematics at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA), affiliated with Tsinghua University, Beijing. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, also at Tsinghua.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before that, I received my PhD in pure maths at Harvard University. My undergraduate education comprised a BA in pure maths (the mathematical tripos) and an MMath degree (Part III) from Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I am interested in both pure and applied mathematics. In pure maths, I spent my undergraduate and graduate years studying algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry, particularly p-curvature. In applied maths, my primary collaborator is Nick James of the University of Melbourne. We try to work on various topical problems and develop new mathematical techniques to tackle them, with many experiments. We have concluded a body of work on COVID-19, and have ongoing interest in various topics, including financial markets, cryptocurrencies, gun violence, terrorism, environmental topics, and statistical methodology.</p>

<h2>Selected fellowships and awards</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Postdoctoral fellowship completion with Distinction, Tsinghua University, 2021. In China, postdocs are treated a little like degrees, with a final thesis submission, defence, etc. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), Advance HE, 2021. <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship">Home website</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship, Harvard University, 2013. <a href="https://frankknox.harvard.edu">Home website</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>G.F.A Osborn Prize for first place in second year mathematics, Trinity College, Cambridge, 2011.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>T.G. Room Award for first in Extension 2 mathematics, NSW, 2009. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110323043756/https://www.mansw.nsw.edu.au/studentservices/tgroom-award.htm">Archived website</a>. It looks like MANSW abandoned their website, but there's some nice history there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>International Mathematical Olympiad silver medal, 2007 and 2008. <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=15396">Historical website</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Useful links</h2>
<p>There's a nice function on arXiv to create a personal author page, where all your papers are lined up together. It's more reliable than searching by an author's name in the search bar. <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/menzies_m_1.html">My personal arXiv page is here</a>.</p>
<p>I like the Mathematics Genealogy Project. Here is <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=256318">my personal page</a>.</p>
<p>I also like ORCID ID's, and encourage everyone to sign up for one. It's really quick (much quicker than getting a MGP profile...). Here is <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-8435">my page</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm a big fan of open source end-to-end encrypted applications. <a href="https://signal.org/en/"> Signal</a> is an alternative to WhatsApp that is actually encrypted rather than likely not, and its call quality is much better. <a href="https://meet.jit.si/"> Jitsi</a> is an alternative to Zoom that is superior in every way. It is completely free, open source, encrypted, easier to use, and requires no sign-up to create a meeting.
